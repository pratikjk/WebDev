Take or Mock up a version of your resume

Produce a .HTML file containing the structure/content

* If you do not have a copy of your resume, use your knowledge of yourself and your skills to produce an on-the-fly resume
* Add images, links, listsâ€¦ anything to provide value
* Add list of skills and relative level similar to skills survey from earlier 
* Not looking for a replica of the paper resume in web form
* Grading will be on separation of concerns, complexity, readability, correctness of form.


Show off a little. Everything marked with headers/paragraphs only does not show much skill.

* Tables, lists, etc. can be used to convey information (make sure you are NOT using these elements to affect presentation).
* Add pictures and links. This is an opportunity to produce a resume with more zing than straight text.
* Clarify any unfamiliar GPA systems, Honors, Operating Systems, Languages, projects, perhaps by linking to resources.
* Expanding on the resume information is absolutely ok. 

You may need to do some investigation on further HTML commands in order to represent your content appropriately. Not every needed command has been demonstrated. 


Notes

* Not the time to think of visual design.   
* Like items should be marked similarly
* More investigation into HTML command may be necessary

You can copy this HTML for the CSS exercise and can modify it for the CSS exercise later
